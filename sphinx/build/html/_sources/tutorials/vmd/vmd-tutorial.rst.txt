.. container:: justify

    Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is a free molecular graphics software
    that can be used to visualize molecular dynamics systems. VMD has been
    used to generate all the images of molecular systems here. 

.. container:: justify

    The goal of this extra tutorial is to provide some tips
    to make good-looking pictures and videos of molecular systems.

Practical example
=================

.. container:: justify

    To follow this tutorial, |dump_download| this LAMMPS trajectory file, which
    corresponds to a mixture of water and toluene.

.. |dump_download| raw:: html

   <a href="../../../../../lammpstutorials-inputs/vmd/dump.lammpstrj" target="_blank">download</a>

.. container:: justify

    The water molecules use *types* 1 and 2, and the toluene molecules use
    *types* 3, 4, and 5.

.. container:: justify

    With Ubuntu/Linux, the *lammptrj* file can be opened with VMD by typing in a
    terminal:

..  code-block:: bash
    
    vmd dump.lammpstrj

.. container:: justify

    Otherwise, simply open VMD and import the *dump.lammpstrj* file manually
    using *File -> New molecule*.

.. container:: justify

    Go to *Display*, change the view to *Orthographic*, and unselect
    *Depth Cueing*.

.. container:: justify

    Still in *Display*, select
    *Axes -> Off*.

    view.

The representation
------------------

.. container:: justify

    In the main windows of VMD, go to *Graphics, Representations*.
    Within the *Selected Atoms* windows,
    replace *all*
    by *type 1*.
    Here, *type 1* corresponds to the oxygen of the water molecule. 
    Change the *Drawing Method*
    from *Lines*
    to *VDW*.
    Tune the *Sphere Scale*
    to 0.9, and increase the resolution to 52.

.. container:: justify

    Click on *Create Rep* to create a second representation for the hydrogen
    of water, select *type 2*,
    and change the *Sphere Scale* to 0.5.

.. container:: justify

    Create a third representation for *type 3 4 5*,
    i.e. all 3 atom types of toluene, respectively
    carbon, hydrogen, and another carbon.

.. container:: justify

    Choose *DynamicBonds*
    and increase the *bond resolution* to 52.
    With *DynamicBonds*, the ends of the bonds are rough. 
    To smooth out the representation, create the
    fourth and last representation (*VDW* with
    *Sphere Scale* 0.2)
    for *types* 3 4 5*.

The colors
----------

.. container:: justify

    To change the colors, go to *Graphics, Colors*,
    click on *Display*,
    then *Background*, and choose 
    the color you prefer (white is better for publication, black
    can be good looking on presentation with a dark background).

.. container:: justify

    Still in the *Color Controls* windows,
    in *Categories*,
    click *Name*.
    In the *Names* sub windows
    choose *3* (carbon) and select the color silver. Then, do
    the same for 5 (also a carbon :math:`\to` silver),
    4 (hydrogen :math:`\to` white),
    2 (hydrogen :math:`\to` white),
    1 (oxygen :math:`\to` cyan).
    
.. container:: justify

    Note that the cyan color is not standard for
    oxygen. Feel free to change it based on your taste.
    
.. container:: justify

    Let us slightly change the original *cyan* of VMD
    by entering
    manually the values 0.3, 1.0 and 1.0 in the RGB box.

The materials
-------------

.. container:: justify

    In the *Representations* windows, you can choose
    among several materials that are more or less shiny
    or opaque. 
    
.. container:: justify
    
    Let us select the default material named *Opaque*,
    and change *Diffuse*,
    *Specular*, and
    *Shininess*, to 0.56, 0.12, and 0.29, respectively.

Additional options and rendering
================================

Transparent field
-----------------

.. container:: justify

    A great representation offered by VMD is the *Quick surf*,
    that can be combined with *transparent* material.

.. container:: justify

    Here I turned off *Light 0*,
    and turned on all three other default lights.

.. container:: figurelegend

Goodsell
--------

.. container:: justify

    VMD also offers the Goodsell cartoon-like representation, 
    which can be an interesting alternative.

.. container:: figurelegend

Box border
----------

.. container:: justify

    Optionally, you can visualize the borders of the simulation
    box by typing in the VMD terminal:

..  code-block:: bash

    pbc box -center origin -color black -width 2

Saving a state
--------------

.. container:: justify

    To avoid redoing all these steps every time
    VMD is re-opened, one can save the VMD state by
    clicking *File → Save vizualisation state*.
    This state can then be used simply by clicking *File* 
    :math:`\to`
    *Load vizualisation state*.

Rendering image
---------------

.. container:: justify

    To generate high a resolution image, go in *File → Render*,
    choose *Tachyon*,
    hit *Start Rendering*.

Rendering movie
---------------

.. container:: justify

    To generate a high-resolution movie, go into *Extension, Vizualisation*,
    and *Movie Maker*.
    
.. container:: justify

    If you hit *Make Movie* directly, the movie generated by VMD will be
    of poor quality.
    Instead, it is better to generate a sequence of high-resolution
    images, and assemble these images.
    
.. container:: justify

    Go in *Movie Settings*, hit *Trajectory* (so the movie will show
    the system evolving in time, and not rotating on itself),
    Uncheck *Delete image files*.
    In *Rendered*, choose *Tachyon*,
    then hit *Make Movie*. 

.. container:: justify

    From the Linux terminal (not the VMD terminal), assemble the images
    (all starting with *untitled*) into a single movie by typing:

..  code-block:: bash

    ffmpeg -r 60 -i untitled.%05d.ppm -vcodec libx264 \
        -crf 0  -pix_fmt yuv420p myvideo.mp4

.. container:: justify

    You may receive the following error:
    
..  code-block:: bash
    
    width not divisible by 2 (1363x1134)

.. container:: justify

    In that case, simply remove one line of pixel with the command:

..  code-block:: bash

    for file in untitled.*.ppm; do convert $file -crop 1362x1134+0+0 $file; done

.. container:: justify

    To convert the video in *webp*, for web integration, use:

..  code-block:: bash

    ffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -vcodec libwebp -filter:v fps=fps=20 \
        -lossless 1 -loop 0 -preset default -an -vsync 0 myvideo.webp
