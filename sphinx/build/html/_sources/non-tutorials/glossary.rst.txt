Compute
=======

A *compute* is a command that calculates and outputs specific quantities during a
simulation, such as energy, temperature, or pressure. 

Dump file
=========

The *dump* command writes particle coordinates, velocities, and other
information to a file for post-mortem analysis or visualization.

Input script
============

The *input script* is a text file where users define simulation parameters,
forces, constraints, and other settings using LAMMPS commands.

Fix
===

A *fix* is a command that performs specific tasks during a simulation,
such as imposing constraints, applying forces, or modifying particle properties.

Neighbor list
=============

Neighbor list enumerates all pairs of atoms with separation smaller than the
cutoff distance.

Pair style
==========

The *pair_style* command sets the potential interactions between pairs of atoms
(e.g. Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, Morse).

Restart file
============

Restart files allow users to continue simulations from a saved state.

Run
===

A *run* is a command that executes the simulation for a specified number of time steps.

Time step
=========

The simulation progresses through discrete time steps.
