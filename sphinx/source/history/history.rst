Quick history
*************

Past, present, and future of LAMMPStutorials.github.io

Creation
========

I created lammpstutorials in  January 2021 (date of the first commit on Github). The initial goals were to

* help new LAMMPS user with the basic commands
* provide advanced-level tutorials that are close to my current research
* teach the basic of molecular dynamics

Two first points have been partially addressed, but there is still work to be done concerning the third one.

Version 2.0
===========

In february 2023, I published the version 2.0 of lammpstutorials. The `version1.0`_ is still visible here, but is not maintained and 
some commands are likely to be obsolete.

Future
======

There are several aspects that I want to implement, such as:

* create automated testing to systematically check all the tutorials and inputs
* have more monte-carlo tutorials
* have more fundamentals of molecular simulations explained 

I also would like to implicate more people, such as contributors and testers. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
