<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this tutorial is to use molecular dynamics and simulate the deformation of a single layer of graphene. If you already have a good grasp on LAMMPS, you can download directly the input scripts that will be written following this tutorial by clicking <a href="Inputs/GrapheneUnderDeformation.zip" target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault">here</a>.

<br><br>

<b>Prerequisite:</b> If you are new to LAMMPS, I recommend you to follow <a href="tutorial01.html">tutorial 01</a> first.

<h2>Generation of the graphene sheet</h2>

<p>
The initial configuration (atoms positions, bonds, angles, etc) is generated using <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/" target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault">VMD</a>. Open VMD, and go to Extensions, Modeling, Nanotube Builder. A window named Carbon Nanostructures opens, and from this window it is possible to generate a sheet of graphene or BN, as well as a nanotube. For this tutorial, we are going to generate a 4 nm per nm sheet of graphene. Simply change the values of "Edge length along x" and "Edge length along y" to 4, and click on "Generate Sheet(s)". You shoud see this:<br> <br>
<a href="#" class="image"><img src="./Figures/tutorial04_generatedgraphene.png" alt="" /></a>
<br> <br>
At this point, you don't have a molecular dynamics simulations, but a cloud of dots that looks like graphene. In order to generate the initial LAMMPS data file, let us use Topotool and estimate which dots must be connected by bonds using a distance criteria. In the VMD terminal, enter the following command:
<pre><code>topo writelammpsdata data.lammps full
</code></pre></p><p>
More details about this command can be found on the personal page of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/akohlmey/software/topotools" target="_blank">Axel Kohlmeyer</a>. In short, Topotool deduces the location of bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers from the positions of the atoms, and generates a file that can be read by LAMMPS. The keyword "full" corresponds to the LAMMPS atom full style (other possibilities include atomic, bond, charge, etc). The parameters of the constraints (bond length, dihedral coefficients, etc.) will be given later. A new file named "data.lammps" has been created, alternatively you can download the file <a href="Inputs/GrapheneUnderDeformation.zip" target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault">here</a>. It starts like that:
<pre><code>LAMMPS data file. CGCMM style. atom_style full generated by VMD/TopoTools v1.7 on Tue Jan 12 19:39:40 GMT 2021
 680 atoms
 983 bonds
 1894 angles
 3665 dihedrals
 608 impropers
 1 atom types
 1 bond types
 1 angle types
 1 dihedral types
 1 improper types
 -0.5 0.5  xlo xhi
 -0.5 0.5  ylo yhi
 -0.5 0.5  zlo zhi

# Pair Coeffs
#
# 1  CA
</code></pre></p><p>
As you can see, the data.lammps file contains information about the positions of the carbons atoms, as well as the identity of the atoms linked by bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers constraints. 

<br><br>


Currently, there is one small issue with the file as generated with Topotool: the box coordinates are "-0.5 0.5". If we use LAMMPS system of units named 'real', it means that the box goes from -0.5 Angstrom to 0.5 Angstrom in X, Y, and Z, which is of course too short. Let us change it to:
<pre><code> -20 60  xlo xhi
 -20 60  ylo yhi
 -20 60  zlo zhi
</code></pre></p><p>
Save the "data.lammps" file in the same folder as your future LAMMPS input script. We are done with the system generation, we can start the molecular dynamics simulations.

<h2>LAMMPS input script</h2>

<p>
Create a new text file and name it "input.lammps". Copy the following lines:
<pre><code># Initialisation

variable	T equal 300

units		real
atom_style	full
boundary	p p p
pair_style	lj/cut 14

bond_style	harmonic
angle_style	harmonic
dihedral_style	opls
improper_style	harmonic

special_bonds	lj 0.0 0.0 0.5

# System definition
read_data	data.lammps
</code></pre></p><p>
Most of these command lines have been seen already in previous tutorials (see <a href="tutorial01.html">tutorial 01</a> and see <a href="tutorial03.html">tutorial 03</a>), with a few differences: first, the pair style here is lj/cut with parameter 14, which means that the atoms closer than 14 Angstroms from each others interact through a Lennard-Jones potential. Notice that there is no Coulombic interaction, because all the atoms in pure graphene have a charge of 0. The bond, angle, dihedral, and improper styles specify the potential, you can refer to the LAMMPS website (see for example the <a href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/dihedral_opls.html" class="removelinkdefault">OPLS dihedral style</a>). The three numbers of the special bonds command are weighting factors for the Lennard-Jones interaction between atoms connected by bond (respectively directly bounded, separated by two bonds, etc.). The first weighting factor, with a value of 0, means that two atoms connected by a bond do not interact through LJ potential. Then the read data command opens the data.lammps file previously generated with VMD, which contains the information about the box size, atoms positions, etc. 
									
<br><br>
									
What we need now is a force field. Create a new text file and name it "PARM.lammps". Copy the following lines in it:
<pre><code>pair_coeff 	1 1 0.066047 3.4
bond_coeff 	1 469 1.4
angle_coeff 	1 63 120
dihedral_coeff	1 0 7.25 0 0
improper_coeff	1 5 180
</code></pre></p><p>
The pair_coeff indicates the Lennard-jones parameters for the only type of atom of the simulation, carbon (of index 1). The bond_coeff (respectively angle_coeff, dihedral_coeff, improper_coeff) indicates the energy and equilibrium distance of the only type of bond (respectively angle, dihedral, improper) in the simulation: C-C (or 1-1). The file PARM.file can be included in the simulation by adding the following line to input.lammps:
<pre><code>include	PARM.lammps					
</code></pre></p><p>
The goal of the present simulation is to impose a deformation to the sheet. To do so, add the following lines to the input script :
<pre><code># Simulation settings

group		gcar type 1
variable	xmax equal bound(gcar,xmax)-0.5
variable	xmin equal bound(gcar,xmin)+0.5
region		rtop block ${xmax} INF INF INF INF INF
region		rbot block INF ${xmin} INF INF INF INF
region		rmid block ${xmin} ${xmax} INF INF INF INF
</code></pre></p><p>
The first command includes all of the atoms of type one (i.e. all of our atoms here) in a group named gcar. Then, two variables are defined: \(x_\mathrm{max}\) corresponds to the coordinate of the last atoms along \(x\) minus 0.5 Angstroms, and \(x_\mathrm{min}\) to the coordinate of the first atoms along \(x\) plus 0.5 Angstroms. Then, 3 regions are defined , and correspond respectively to \(x < x_\mathrm{min}\), \(x_\mathrm{min} > x > x_\mathrm{max} \) and \(x > x_\mathrm{max}\). Then groups of atoms corresponding to the atoms located in each regions respectively can be defined:
<pre><code>group		gtop region rtop
group		gbot region rbot
group		gmid region rmid
</code></pre></p><p>
When running the simulation, the number of atoms in each group is printed in the terminal, you can control there that you did not make any mistake:
<pre><code>680 atoms in group gcar
20 atoms in group gtop
20 atoms in group gbot
640 atoms in group gmid
</code></pre>
Let us specify the thermalisation and the dynamics of the system. Add the following lines to input.lammps:
<pre><code>velocity	gmid create ${T} 48455 mom yes rot yes
fix		mynve all nve
compute		Tmid gmid temp
fix		myber gmid temp/berendsen ${T} ${T} 100
fix_modify	myber temp Tmid
</code></pre></p><p>
The "velocity create" command gives initial velocities to the atoms of the group gmid, assuring an initial temperature of \(300\,\)K for these atoms. NVE integration is applied to all atoms, and a Berendsen thermostat is applied to the atoms of the group gmid only. The "fix modify" ensures that the fix Berendsten use the temperature of the group gmid as an input, instead of the temperature of whole system. The atoms of the edges are not thermalised because their motion will be restrained.

<br><br>

To restrain the motion of the atoms at the edges, add the following commands:
<pre><code>fix 		mysf1 gtop setforce 0 NULL 0
fix 		mysf2 gbot setforce 0 NULL 0
velocity	gtop set 0 NULL 0
velocity	gbot set 0 NULL 0
</code></pre></p><p>
The setforce commands cancel the forces applied on the atoms of both edges during the whole simulation along \(x\) and \(z\), and the velocity commands cancel the initial velocities along \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, the atoms of the edges will remain immobile during the simulation (if no other command is applied to them). 

<br><br>

All the important commands have been written. In order to measure the strain and stress in the graphene sheet, let us extract the distance \(L\) between the two edges as well as the force applied on the edges. Let us also create a dump file containing the trajectories (for VMD).
<pre><code>variable	L equal xcm(gtop,x)-xcm(gbot,x)
fix 		at1 all ave/time 10 100 1000 v_L file length.dat
fix 		at2 all ave/time 10 100 1000 f_mysf1[1] f_mysf2[1] file force.dat
dump 		mydmp all atom 1000 dump.lammpstrj
</code></pre></p><p>

Notice that the values of the forces on each edge are extracted from the fixes mysf1 and mysf2. These fixes cancel the force on a group of atoms, but allow to extract the values of the force before its cancelation. This is what we are doing here. Let us run a small equilibration step.
<pre><code>thermo		100
thermo_modify 	temp Tmid

# Run

timestep	1.0
run		5000
</code></pre></p><p>
When using the thermo_modify command, we specify to LAMMPS that we want the temperature \(T_\mathrm{mid}\) to be printed in the terminal, not the total temperature. Then, we perform a loop. At each step of the loop, the edges are slightly displaced, and the simulation runs for a short time. 
<pre><code>variable 	var loop 10
label 		loop
displace_atoms	gtop move 0.1 0 0
displace_atoms	gbot move -0.1 0 0
run		1000
next		var
jump 		input.lammps loop
</code></pre></p><p>
