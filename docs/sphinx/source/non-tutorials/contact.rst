About LAMMPS tutorials
======================

Since its launch in 2019, this website has evolved
considerably -- and will likely continue to do so.
A citable pdf version is available on |gravelle2025tutorials_arXiv|.

You can follow the progress of LAMMPS tutorials via:

- the |github_lammps_tutorials| account of LAMMPS tutorials,
- the |mastodon_lammps_tutorials| account of LAMMPS tutorials.

Contact the founder
===================

You can reach the founder of LAMMPS tutorials, |simongravelle_page|, for suggestions,  
to report issues with the website, or to ask general questions about LAMMPS
or molecular simulations.
