Hydrate the structure
---------------------

Add water molecules to the current structure, and follow the reactions over
time.

    Figure: Cracked silicon oxide after the addition of water
    molecules. The atoms are colored by their charges.

A slightly acidic bulk solution
-------------------------------

Create a bulk water system with a few hydronium ions (:math:`H_3O^+`
or :math:`H^+`) using ReaxFF. The addition of hydronium ions will make the
system acidic.
