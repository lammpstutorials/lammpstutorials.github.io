In this tutorial, the system of interest is a small, single-walled carbon
nanotube (CNT) in an empty box.  The CNT is strained
by imposing a constant velocity on the edge atoms.  To illustrate the
difference between conventional and reactive force fields, this tutorial
is divided into two parts: in the first part, a conventional molecular
force field (called OPLS-AA :cite:`jorgensenDevelopmentTestingOPLS1996`)
is used and the bonds between the atoms of the CNT are unbreakable.  In
the second part, a reactive force field (called AIREBO :cite:`stuart2000reactive`)
is used, which allows chemical bonds to break under large strain.
