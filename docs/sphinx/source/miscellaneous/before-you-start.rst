Required softwares
==================

    Download and install LAMMPS by following the instructions of the |LAMMPS website|.
    Alternatively, if you are using Ubuntu OS, you can simply execute the
    following command in a terminal:

..  code-block:: bw

   sudo apt-get install lammps

..  container:: justify

    You can verify that LAMMPS is indeed installed on your
    computer by typing in a terminal :

..  code-block:: bw

    lmp

..  container:: justify

    You should see the version of LAMMPS that has been
    installed. On my computer I see

..  code-block:: bw

    LAMMPS (29 Sep 2021 - Update 2)

    In addition to LAMMPS, you will also need |(1) a basic text editing software|
    such as Vim, Gedit, or Notepad++, |(2) a visualization software|, here I
    will use VMD (note: VMD is free but you have to register to
    the uiuc website in order to download it. If you don't want
    to, you can also use Ovito.), |(3) a plotting tool| like
    XmGrace or pyplot.
