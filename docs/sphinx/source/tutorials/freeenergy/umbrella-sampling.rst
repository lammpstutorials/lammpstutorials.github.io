    The objective of this tutorial is to combine molecular
    dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to
    simulate the adsorption of water molecules in a cracked
    silica.

    This tutorial illustrates the use of the grand canonical
    ensemble in molecular simulation, an ensemble in which the number of 
    molecule/atom is not constant.
