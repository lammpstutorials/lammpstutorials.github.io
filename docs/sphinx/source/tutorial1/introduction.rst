The objective of this tutorial is to perform simple MD simulations
using LAMMPS.  The system consists of a Lennard-Jones fluid composed of
neutral particles with two different effective diameters, contained
within a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions.  In this tutorial, basic MD simulations in
the microcanonical (NVE) and canonical (NVT) ensembles are performed,
and basic quantities are calculated, including the potential and kinetic
energies.
