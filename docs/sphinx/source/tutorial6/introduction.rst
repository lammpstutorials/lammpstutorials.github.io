The objective of this tutorial is to combine molecular
dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to
compute the adsorption of water molecules in cracked silica material.

This tutorial illustrates the use of the grand canonical
ensemble in molecular simulation, an open ensemble in which
the number of atoms or molecules within the simulation box is not constant.
When using the grand canonical ensemble, it is possible to impose
the chemical potential (or pressure) of a given fluid
in a nanoporous structure.
