	Warning: This tutorial may be obsolete.

	<br><br>

In this tutorial, we are going to simulate the capillary filling of a LJ fluid in a disordered porous medium. If you are not already familiar with LAMMPS and molecular dynamics, I suggest you to follow <a href="01-SimpleMolecularSimulation.html">tutorial 1</a> first. 

<br><br>

<p>
	If you already have a good grasp on LAMMPS, you can download directly the input scripts that will be written following this tutorial on
	<a href="https://github.com/lammpstutorials/lammpstutorials.github.io/tree/main/inputs/extra-02-CapillaryFilling/"
	target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault">Github</a>.

<h2>Step 1 -- Equilibrated fluid </h2>
<br>
<p>
We are going to create the fluid and the solid separately. Let us first create a block of LJ fluid at equilibrium pressure and temperature. In a folder, create a new input script called input.fluid.lammps, and copy the following lines in it:
<pre><code># Initialisation

units		lj
pair_style	lj/cut 2.5
atom_style	atomic
boundary	p p p

# System definition

region		mybox block -17 17 -8 8 -8 8
create_box	3 mybox
create_atoms	2 random 6500 341341 mybox

# Simulation settings

mass		* 1
pair_coeff	* * 1.0 1.0
neigh_modify	every 1 delay 4 check yes
dump 		mydmp all atom 1000 dump.fluid.lammpstrj

# Run

thermo		100
minimize	1.0e-4 1.0e-6 1000 10000
reset_timestep	0

thermo		1000
velocity 	all create 1.0 4928459 mom yes rot yes dist gaussian
fix		mynpt all npt temp 1.0 1.0 0.1 x 1.0 1.0 1.0
run		10000
write_data	data.fluid.lammps
</code></pre></p><p>
If you followed tutorials <a href="01-SimpleMolecularSimulation.html">1</a>, you may notice 3 novelties here. First, the absence of the command 'dimension 2' in the 'Initialisation' section. Implicitly, we are using 'dimension 3' but we don't have to specify it because it is the default value. Another novelty is that we use the '*' in the mass and pair_coeff command, therefore the commands apply to all three atom types of the simulation. Finally we are using the npt command. This command replaces the 'nve' and 'langevin' previously used. This command performs a time integration that is consistent with the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, and updates the position and velocity for atoms each timestep. Here, the npt command is used to impose a temperature of 1 (unitless) to all of the atom (there are only atoms of type 2 in the present simulation) as well as a pressure of 1 (unitless). In order to impose the pressure, only the 'x' dimension of the box is adjusted until the desired pressure is reached. This way the dimensions of the box along y and z remain unchanged, which will be practical later. You can run this script using LAMMPS. You should see the following in the terminal: 
</p>

</code></pre></p><p>
Due to the use of the npt command, the volume of the box is adjusting, and both pressure and temperature oscillate near 1. The final configuration of the simulation has been saved in 'data.fluid.lammps' and will be usefull later. 
</p>

<h2>Step 2 -- Equilibrated porous medium </h2>
<br>
<p>

Let us create a porous medium. Do to so, we are going to first create a fluid with a density slightly lower than the density of a liquid. We are going to let the atoms reorganise slightly (they are going to form some cluster). Then we are going to freeze them (by reducing the temperature). By doing so, the following structure will be generated, and this structure will then be used as a porous medium:

<br><br>

<span class="image main"><img src="../figures/extra02-CapillaryFilling/porousmedia.jpg" alt="" /></span>

<br><br>

Create a new input file, name it input.porous.lammps, and copy the following lines:
<pre><code># Initialization

units		lj
pair_style	lj/cut 2.5
atom_style	atomic
boundary	p p p

# System definition

region		mybox block -30 30 -8 8 -8 8
create_box	3 mybox
region		myblk1 block -30 30 -8 8 -8 8
create_atoms	1 random 6500 151522 myblk1

# Simulation settings

pair_coeff	* * 1.0 1.0
neigh_modify	every 1 delay 4 check yes
dump 		mydmp all atom 1000 dump.porous.lammpstrj

# Run

thermo		100
minimize	1.0e-4 1.0e-6 1000 10000
reset_timestep	0

thermo		100

fix		mynve all nve
fix		mylgv all langevin 1.0 0.0 0.1 1530917 zero yes
run		10000

change_box 	all x final -65 65

write_data	data.porous.lammps
</code></pre></p><p>
At this point you should be familiar with all the commands in this script. There is one subtility however, in the Langevin command, the initial temperature (=1) is different from the final temperature (0), therefore the imposed temperature will gradually decrease from 1 to 0 during the 10000 steps. In addition, just before writing the data in data.porous.lammps, the dimensions of the box are changed along the x direction. This way, the box will be large enough for the liquid to be added in the next step. The command 'change_box' does not affect the present calculation, because it appears after our last 'run' command. Run LAMMPS with the input.porous.lammps script to generate the data.porous.lammps.

</p>

<h2>Step 3 -- Capillary filling simulation </h2>
<br>
<p>
We now want to perform the simulation of capillary filling. Do to so, we need to put into contact our previously generated fluid with our previously generated porous medium. In addition, we want the pressure in the LJ liquid to be maintained at 1 (unitless), for which we are going to use a piston to press on it. If we don't, the pressure in the fluid will decrease to 0, and it will ressemble a gas and not a liquid. You can observe this phenomena by running the input.fluid.lammps script with a pressure of 0.  

<br><br>Let us proceed step-by-step. Create a new script, call it input.filling.lammps, and copy the following lines:
<pre><code># Initialization

units		lj
pair_style	lj/cut 2.5
atom_style	atomic
boundary	p p p

# System definition

read_data	data.porous.lammps
read_data	data.fluid.lammps add append
</code></pre></p><p>
LAMMPS allows you to read multiple data file. Here we start by opening data.porous.lammps, then we open data.fluid.lammps with the additional keywords 'add append' indicating that the ids of the atoms from data.fluid.lammps will be shifted (each atom has a number that must be unique, you must avoid overlap) . If you run this script you will see:
<pre><code>Reading data file ...
  orthogonal box = (-65 -10 -10) to (65 10 10)
  1 by 1 by 1 MPI processor grid
  reading atoms ...
  7000 atoms
  reading velocities ...
  7000 velocities
  read_data CPU = 0.0152357 secs
Reading data file ...
  orthogonal box = (-65 -10 -10) to (65 10 10)
  1 by 1 by 1 MPI processor grid
  reading atoms ...
  10000 atoms
  reading velocities ...
  10000 velocities
  read_data CPU = 0.0173977 secs
Total wall time: 0:00:00
</code></pre></p><p>
LAMMPS reads the two data files, and uses the box dimension of data.porous.lammps, and not the one of data.fluid.lammps, as anticipated. We still need to shift the positions of the atoms (the positions of the fluid and solid atoms are currently overlapping).
<pre><code># Simulation settings

group		sol type 1
group		liqinit type 2
mass		* 1
pair_coeff	* * 1.0 1.0

# move solid
variable	solhi equal -1*(bound(sol,xmax)+0.5)
displace_atoms	sol move ${solhi} 0 0

# move liquid
variable	liqlo equal -1*(bound(liqinit,xmin)-0.5)
displace_atoms	liqinit move ${liqlo} 0 0

# define piston
variable	pstlo equal bound(liqinit,xmax)-4
region		myblock block ${pstlo} INF INF INF INF INF
group		pst region myblock
set		group pst type 3
group		liq type 2

neigh_modify	every 1 delay 5 check yes
neigh_modify	exclude group sol sol
neigh_modify	exclude group pst pst
</code></pre></p><p>
In the 'move solid' subsection, the location of the solid atoms with the maximum coordinate along x is detected, and used to shift the position of the entire solid along x. The solid is now located in x<0. 

<br><br>

The same is done for the liquid in the 'move liquid' subsection, so the liquid is located in x>0 with no overlap with the solid. 

<br><br>

Then, in the 'define piston' section, a layer of width = 4 (unitless) is identified (corresponding to the atoms that are far from the porous media). The atoms in this layer are labelled as pst for piston, and their type is changed from 2 to 3. Then the atoms that still have the id '2' are put in the group named liq. We have now three groups of atoms: sol, liq, and pst (the group liqinit contains the atoms of groups liq + pst, and will not be used in the following). To give you an idea, the system currently looks like that, with the piston on the right, the solid on the left, and the liquid in between:

<br><br>

<span class="image main"><img src="../figures/extra02-CapillaryFilling/system.jpg" alt="" /></span>

We can write the last part of the code. The groups liq and pst will be treated separately, as we want the atoms of the liquid to move freely (except for the constant temperature), and the atoms of the piston to move as a block, and to apply a force on the liquid (the force will be along x and will push from right to left, so that the liquid will be maintained as a constant pressure). During this simulation, the atoms of the solid will be kept immobile, to do so, we simply don't perform a time integration for these atoms (i.e. we do not apply any fix nve of npt to these atoms). Copy the next lines:
<pre><code># Run
# piston
fix		mynve1 pst nve
fix		mysfr pst setforce NULL 0 0
variable	npst equal count(pst)
variable	areaYZ equal ly*lz
variable	press equal 1
variable	fpa equal ${press}*${areaYZ}/${npst}
fix		myafr pst aveforce -${fpa} NULL NULL
velocity	pst set 0 0 0

# liquid
velocity 	liq create 1.0 4928459 mom yes rot yes dist gaussian
fix		mynve2 liq nve
compute	tliq liq temp
fix		mylgv liq langevin 1.0 1.0 0.1 1530917 zero yes
fix_modify	mylgv temp tliq

dump 		mydmp all atom 1000 dump.filling.lammpstrj
thermo		10000
run		1000000
write_data	data.equilibrium
</code></pre></p><p>
For the atoms of the piston to move as a block, we use the fixes 'setforce' and 'aveforce'. First, the fix setforce ensures that all the forces along y and z applied on the atoms of the group pst are cancelled during the simulation (no force -> no change in velocity -> no change in position). The fix aveforce averages all the forces along x applied on the atoms of group pst, therefore all the atoms of the group always feel the same force. As a consequence, they move as a block along x. In addition, the fix aveforce also adds a force equal to -fpa to the atoms of the group, where fpa as been calculated to correspond to a pressure of 1 (unitless). 

<br><br>

It is very important to cancel the initial velocities of the atoms of the piston using 'velocity set', because 'setforce' and 'addforce' only affect the acceleration (if its not clear, you can try to run a simulation without the 'set velocity', the issue should be visible).

<br><br>

The atoms of the liquid are treated as usual (i.e. nve + langevin), except that we have to use a fix_modify to ensure that the fix langevin uses the temperature of the liquid as an input, and not the temperature of the whole system (because the atoms of the solid have a temperature of 0).
