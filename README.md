# LAMMPS tutorials

Welcome to the repository of the [LAMMPS Tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/)
webpage. All the LAMMPS input scripts and data files can be found in the [inputs](docs/inputs/) folder.
The Python scripts used to generate the figures are also provided.

## About LAMMPS tutorials

LAMMPS tutorials is made of seven tutorials that are ordered by increasing difficulty.
[Lennard-Jones fluid](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level1/lennard-jones-fluid.html)
is meant for absolute LAMMPS and molecular dynamics beginners, and the complexity of the simulation is
progressively increased for [Pulling on a carbon nanotube](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level1/breaking-a-carbon-nanotube.html), 
[Polymer in water](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level2/polymer-in-water.html), 
[Nanosheared electrolyte](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level2/nanosheared-electrolyte.html),
and [Reactive silicon dioxide](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level3/reactive-silicon-dioxide.html). 
Finally, [Water adsorption in silica](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level3/water-adsorption-in-silica.html),
[Free energy calculation](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/level3/free-energy-calculation.html), 
are using some more advanced simulation methods that are commonly used when studying soft matter systems, respectively grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and a free energy method named umbrella sampling.

### Template

The template from the first page has been adapted from HTML5 UP. The other pages are
using sphinx with the furo style.

### You noticed a mistake in one of the tutorial?

You can report issue here on Github, or send me an [email](https://simongravelle.github.io/). Your feedback is always highly appreciated.

### About me ###

I am a computer physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces. You can 
find more information on my [personal webpage](https://simongravelle.github.io/).
