This is the repository of the [LAMMPS Tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/) webpage. 
All LAMMPS input scripts and data files can be found in the [inputs](docs/inputs/) folder. 

### List of tutorials:

* Lennard Jones binary fluid - simple molecular dynamics simulation
* Polymer in water - constant force applied to the 2 ends of the polymer (polyethylene glycol))
* Nanosheared electrolyte - electrolyte sheared by two walls and velocity profile measurement
* Graphene under deformation - longitudinal deformation of a small graphene sheet
* Breaking a carbon nanotube - carbon nanotube under extreme deformation with reactive force field
