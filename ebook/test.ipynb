      "['The objective of this tutorial is to use a molecular dynamics system made of silicon dioxide (SiO2), and deform it until it breaks. The reactive force field *reaxff* is used, and a particular attention is given to the evolution of the charges of the atoms during the deformation of the structure. ']\n",
      "['Create a folder, name it RelaxSilica/, and |download_silica_data| the initial topology of a small amorphous silica structure. The system was created by temperature annealing using another force field (|download_SiO.1990.vashishta|), therefore the structure is slightly different to what is expected from the reaxff force field. For instance, the average bond lengths, angles, and charges are likely to be different, and the structure needs to be relaxed again using reaxff. If you are interested, the input file used for creating the initial topology is available |lammps_input_creating|, but its description is not part of this tutorial. The Atoms section of the *silica.data* file starts like that: ']\n",
      "['Due to the use of vashishta force field for creating the initial configuration, all silicon atoms have the same charge q = 1.1e, and all oxygen atoms the charge q = -0.55e. This is common to most classical force field. Let us keep that in mind before we start using *reaxff*. The first step is to relax the structure, which we are gonna do using molecular dynamics. To make sure that the system equilibrates nicely, let us track the changes in our system over time. Create an input file called input.lammps in RelaxSilica/, and copy in it: ']\n",
      "['So far, the input is very similar to what is seen in the other tutorials here, with some basic parameters being defined (units, atom_style and masses), and the data file being imported by the *read_data* command. Now let us enter 3 crucial lines: ']\n",
      "['Here, the reaxff pair_style is used with no control file, and the *safezone* and *mincap* keywords have been added for memory allocation issue. If not there, the segmentation faults and bondchk failed errors sometimes occur. The pair_coeff uses the |reaxCHOFe| file which is assumed to be saved in the same folder as the input. The atoms of type 1 are set as silicon (Si), and type 2 as oxygen (O) in order to be consistent with the data file and mass definition. Finally, the fix *qeq/reaxff* is used to perform charge equilibration every timestep. The values 0 and 10.0 are low and high cutoffs, respectively, and 1.0e-6 a tolerance. Finally, maxiter sets a limit to the number of attempt to equilibrate the charge. ']\n",
      "['Then, let us use some (familiar) commands controlling the building of the neighbor lists. Let us also print thermodynamic information, the charge of both atom types, and create a dump file for visualization. ']\n",
      "['Let us perform a very short run using anisotropic NPT command and relax the density of the system. ']\n",
      "['As the simulation runs, you can see that the charges of the atoms are fluctuating, as the atoms adjust themselves to the topology: ']\n",
      "['Moreover, and because each atom adopts its own fluctuating charge value, the charges are distributed around a mean value: ']\n",

      "['The main differences with the previous input are - the use of fix deform for elongating progressively the box along x, - the use of fix NVT instead of NPT (because the box deformation is already ensured by fix deform). After a first run of 25000 steps, a short run of 2000 steps is performed in order to extract the final charges of the atoms from an structure that is not under deformation. During the deformation, the charges progressively changes, until the structure eventually breaks up. After the structure breaks, the charges equilibrates near a new average value that differs from the starting charge, which is expected due to the presence of the new solid/vacuum interface: ']\n",
      "['At the end of the deformation, one can visualize the broken material. Notice the different charge of the atoms located near the interface and compared to the atoms located in the bulk of the material: ']\n",
      "['One O2 molecule was formed during the process (here appearing in green), most likely because the rate of deformation was really high. One can have a look at the final charge distribution: ']\n",
      "['The final charge distribution differs from the previously calculated, as a new peak near -0.5e for the oxygen. ']\n",
      "['Let us add more O2 molecule to our previously equilibrated structure, equilibrate it again, and extract the charge density profile along the x axis. Create a new folder, name it AddOxygen/, and create a new molecule file named O2.mol in it: ']\n",
      "['Here the O2 molecule is simply made of 2 oxygen (type 2) atoms that are not connected by any bond (because there is no need with reaxff). Then, create a new input.lammps file, and copy the same first lines as previously in it: ']\n",
      "['Optionally, let us shift the structure to recenter it in the box. The best value for the shift may be different in your case. This step is not necessary, but the recentered system looks better. ']\n",
